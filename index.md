# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was getting alexa connected to alexa skills kit (ASK) and getting them talking to each other. The tutorials and websites on this subject are very old and alexa has changed a lot since then. There is a lot about connecting Lambda to ASK but alexa does this automatically for you now so I didn't have to worry about that part anymore. You can now code everything directly from ASK so once I figured that out I started trying to link my alexa dev account to my actual alexa. The only way to connect to alexa via a computer is to use firefox so I switched my work to firefox. As long as you use the same account for alexa and the developer account they will automatically connect as a dev skill. I coded a test response in my skill referencing the hello world skill alexa gives you which can be seen in the video.

# Starter Project - Useless machine
  

My starter project was building a Useless machine with the Spikenzie Labs kit. I had to solder resistors, switches, terminals and LEDs onto a printed circuit board. Then I connected the board to a motor. I attached the arm which would be used to turn the main switch off and screwed the entire thing inside a box. I placed a battery pack and connected the battery pack wires and the motor wires to the PCB. The arm initially missed the switch and was slightly offset so I shifted the arm a little and so that it would hit the switch. I then assembled the entire box around the PCB, motor, and battery pack.  I made sure everything worked and that's how I built my Useless Machine.
